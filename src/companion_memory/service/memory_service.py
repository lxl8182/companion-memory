"""Standalone service assembly: one authoritative core, one root owner (S04).

`docs/standalone-service.md` §2.1/§4.2 fix the shape of this module:

* the service process is **the** writable owner of one data root, so it takes
  the S01 root lock before assembling anything and releases it last;
* startup order is load config -> take the lock -> assemble the core -> register
  recovery handlers -> recover barriers/journal/turn records/outbox -> become
  ready -> start background tasks -> open the interfaces;
* capability state is reported separately for storage, chat and background, so
  one missing model neither hides working memory nor claims a working `/chat`.

This module deliberately contains no HTTP. `service/server.py` is the transport
and the only place that knows about status codes, so the assembly can be tested
(and reused by the WebUI) without a socket.
