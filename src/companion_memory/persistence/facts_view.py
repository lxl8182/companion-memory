"""Raw read/write view of the host `facts.json` / `facts_archive.json` pair.

This adapter is deliberately dumb: it stores and returns exactly the objects
the host writes. Fact extraction, dedup, absorb/invalidate and every other
domain rule belongs to B04/B05 and must not leak in here.

Invariants
----------
* On-disk shape stays byte-compatible with the host: both files are a BARE
  JSON ARRAY of objects. No schema envelope is ever written, so a host reader
  keeps working after this adapter wrote a file.
* Reading accepts the bare host array and the versioned envelope
  `{"schema_version": 1, "facts": [...]}` (or `"archive": [...]`) through
  `persistence.schema.load_legacy_list`, so a future migration can move a
  file forward without a second reader. A JSON object without an integer
  `schema_version` is treated as a versioned store this build cannot read
  (`InvalidSchemaError`); any other top-level shape, unparsable JSON, or a
  non-object item is corruption (`CorruptStoreError`). A corrupt or unknown
  file is never rewritten, emptied or "repaired".
* Every object round-trips verbatim: unknown fields are neither filtered nor
  reordered and nothing is defaulted.
* `commit()` writes the archive file BEFORE the active file (see below).
* Every write is preceded by `WritePermit.assert_writable` (single-file
  writes) or wrapped in `WritePermit.transaction` (the two-file commit), so a
  rejecting permit leaves every file untouched.
* Read-modify-write pairs are serialized per character by this instance's
  `threading.Lock`; there is no global data lock.
