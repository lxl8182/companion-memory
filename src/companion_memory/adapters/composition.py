"""Explicit composition of the B03 memory core (no host imports, no globals).

\`build_memory_core\` wires one data root and returns the independent entry
points: durable event ingest (with the deletion barrier in front), correction
and deletion services, and the shared barrier/facts/journal stores. This is
what an embedder (B08) or the standalone entry (B07) constructs; the core
never discovers Documents, host config or the current character on its own.

Recovery order matches B02/B03: the journal replay handlers are registered in
the constructors (source ledger, deletion store, correction store), then
\`MemoryCore.recover\` reconciles the journal before any new write. Barrier
state is read from disk, so replayed deletion events restore the fence even
when the tail contains older source events.
