"""M4 growth evidence: independent experiences and real evidence kinds.

Why this module exists (design sections 3.2, 7.4, 9.3):

* support was counted as `len(source_event_keys)`, i.e. the number of messages.
  One heart-to-heart split into five facts therefore looked like five independent
  experiences and cleared a "two independent experiences" promotion gate on the
  first conversation. Support is now counted per *independent experience*: the
  episode (`fact.episode_id`) when the fact has one, and the evidence key when
  it does not (see the degradation rules below);
* the evidence flags were hard-coded: every key was filed under
  `actual_result`, which made `PROMOTION_RULES` (habit/experience need
  `actual_result` *or* `user_feedback`) grant itself. Flags are now derived
  from the M1 `fact.evidence_kind`; a bare assertion carries no flag and the
  character's own words are not evidence about the user;
* deletion has to recompute with the *same* rule as creation, otherwise support
  is counted per episode while a row is built and per message when a source is
  deleted, and eligibility drifts twice. `apply_support_removal_to_row` is that
  one routine, used by the growth reconcile pass *and* by the deletion cleaner;
* automatic evolution may only propose card changes from a mature strategy or
  understanding. A raw fact stays an explanation source and is reported as
  `fact_not_eligible`.

Degradation rules (documented so they cannot drift silently):

* a fact with an `episode_id` contributes exactly one experience, whatever the
  number of facts, keys or statements in that episode. **The episode wins**: if
  M1 merged sources from two different mentions into one fact that still carries
  `episode_id`, those keys are *not* counted a second time. Rows are attributed
  to the episode they were extracted for; a genuinely independent later
  interaction arrives as its own fact with its own episode. (The reverse rule -
  counting merged keys as extra experiences - would let one conversation's
  re-mentions inflate support, which is exactly the bug this layer removes.)
  An `episode_ids` list on the row is accepted as well; each listed episode is
  one experience;
* a fact without any episode degrades to one experience per distinct evidence
  key: five facts of one message (which share the message key) still collapse to
  one support, while a fact merged from two independent mentions legitimately
  carries two;
* a fact with neither an episode nor keys contributes one experience keyed
  `fact:<id>`; it counts toward the experience total but can never claim a flag
  it did not derive from a real `evidence_kind`;
* `agent_expression` and `quoted_example` facts contribute nothing: her own
  words and borrowed material are not evidence about the user or the
  relationship (design section 7.4: the robot repeating itself adds no support).

Pure functions only: no IO, no clock, no model. The policy tables that must not
move (`PROMOTION_RULES`, `GROWTH_TERMINAL_STATUSES`, the promotion lifecycle)
stay in `domain/reflection.py` and are passed in, so the same gate can be used
by `domain/evolution.py` and `domain/evolution_scheduler.py` without a copy.
