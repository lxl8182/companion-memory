"""B03 forget engine: barrier first, bounded cleanup second, receipt last.

The order is the contract (design §17.9.1, §17.15):

1. **Register the barrier durably.** The deletion record and its tombstones are
   appended to the journal and saved before any content is touched, so a crash
   at any later point leaves the barrier active and cleanup retryable.
2. **Stop using the content.** The barrier cache refreshes immediately, so
   reads and replays stop serving the deleted rows even while cleanup runs.
3. **Clean bounded stores** step by step (\`resolve → facts → reflections →
   persona → recent → cache → plugin\`). Every step is idempotent and recorded
   in the deletion document; a failure leaves \`pending/failed\` steps and the
   receipt stays retryable.
4. **Report.** \`stopped_using\` is true once the barrier is durable;
   \`content_cleaned\` requires all host content steps terminal; an offline
   plugin keeps the whole deletion \`pending\` (never \`completed\`).

Stores this batch owns: facts + archive (raw view), the time index (episode
session rows) and the barrier. Reflection/persona/recent stores arrive in
B04/B05/B10; their steps report \`skipped\` with a batch note until a cleaner is
registered, and the deletion can be retried afterwards.

Entry vs episode scope keeps the host data ranges: an entry deletion removes
facts/archive rows but never original conversation messages; an episode
deletion also removes the time index's conversation rows and fails visibly
when that store is unavailable (it must not pretend the original text is
gone). Resolution results are persisted as tombstones for **both** scopes —
the host only did that for episodes, which let a retried entry deletion miss
derived rows resolved before a failed step.
