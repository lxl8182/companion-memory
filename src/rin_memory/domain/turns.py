"""Whole-turn commit orchestration (S02).

`docs/standalone-service.md` §3.3/§3.4 define the order this module implements:

    validate identity/scope/turn/idempotency key
      -> committed request: replay after the current deletion/correction check
      -> new request: reserve the pending state, fixing input and occurred_at
      -> read persona snapshot, recent session, constraints
      -> generate the reply (service-generation mode)
      -> re-check that the basis was not deleted/corrected/root-switched
      -> persist the whole turn, the generation version and the extraction intent
      -> idempotently apply the message views and the extraction queue
      -> return the committed result; extraction continues in the background

The service deliberately does **not** own the model. Generation is supplied by
the caller as an async callable, so this layer stays usable from the standalone
service (S04), the host, or a test double, and never imports a provider.

Failure semantics that matter for recovery:

* a generation failure leaves the record `failed` (retryable) and the turn id
  unspent, so a retry with the same request id continues instead of duplicating;
* a basis that went stale (deletion/correction after generation) commits
  nothing and returns `context_stale`, per §3.3;
* a crash after the journal entry but before the views are written is repaired
  by `recover()`, which replays the committed snapshot and then finishes the
  missing view work exactly once.
