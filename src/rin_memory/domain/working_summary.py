"""The three rebuildable working summaries plus the episode view (M5).

Design section 5 says the working summaries are *projections*: "they should all
be rebuildable from the authoritative records, and must be rebuilt when a source
goes away. Do not let a summary become a second fact source that cannot be
corrected."

That sentence decides the whole shape of this module:

* every section is derived from records that already exist (published teaching
  rules, growth/reflection rows, active facts, companion state, mention
  directives). Nothing here is stored as truth;
* the read path re-derives on every call, so a deleted source disappears from
  the summary in the same breath as from the store -- there is no cache to go
  stale and nothing to resurrect;
* the on-disk 'working_summary.json' is an audit cache only (see
  persistence.working_summary): it records what the last background round
  computed and carries the 'rebuild_key' of its inputs, but no read path
  consumes it.

Three sections, matching design section 10.1's "current working summary" layer:

    growth          already-formed changes, shared idioms, important
                    relationship nodes -- from published rules, growth and
                    reflection rows, and relationship persona entries
    important_facts what is useful to keep in mind about this person, scope
                    filtered -- from the currently valid facts
    open_threads    what is being worked on, agreements, progress, follow-up
                    time and mention restrictions -- from companion state

The fourth projection, 'episode', is what design section 11.1 calls "one
experience": participants, both sides' behaviour, the actual result, the
terminal state, the next follow-up time and any mention restriction. It is
derived from the facts that carry an episode id plus recent messages, state and
directives rather than written at extraction time, because those are precisely
the fields that form *over later turns* -- an extraction-time snapshot could
only ever record what the first message saw.
