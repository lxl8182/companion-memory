"""Interest evidence for the existing `about_owner` section (RO03).

The user picture is *not* a module, a page or a generated profile any more: it
converges on the editable `about_owner` persona section (RO01). This module is
the evidence layer underneath that section, and it does exactly two things:

1. **Records signals from user utterances only.** A signal says what kind of
   preference the user expressed and which utterances express it:

   | signal    | means                                    | feeds `about_owner` |
   |-----------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|
   | `like`    | an explicit, lasting liking              | yes (stable)         |
   | `dislike` | an explicit, lasting dislike             | yes (avoid)          |
   | `curious` | something new the user wants to try soon | **no** -- it is a    |
   |           |                                          | near-term interest,  |
   |           |                                          | not a trait          |
   | `paused`  | the user asked to drop the topic         | no -- it is a        |
   |           |                                          | constraint           |

   "最近想试胶片" is therefore `curious` and stays out of the section;
   "我一直喜欢胶片摄影" is `like` and may become part of it. Merging the two is
   the failure this split exists to prevent: a passing curiosity written into
   the persona would be recited as a trait for months.

2. **Projects the stable part as *material*, never as prose.** `material()`
   returns stable likes / dislikes / lasting preferences with their source
   references so the section can be written (by the user or by evolution, RO01
   capability) from evidence. This module never edits the section text itself:
   the projection is not a second source of truth.

Every row is bound to the utterances that support it, and a row whose sources
are all gone is dropped on read, not just on delete. Two protections matter more
than the rest:

* **no source, no signal.** A candidate whose `evidence_refs` do not resolve to
  user utterances is discarded. An unattributed preference is worse than no
  preference: it cannot be corrected, deleted or audited, and it is exactly what
  would end up recited as a lasting trait;
* **one voice, one signal.** Rows are deduped by `(subject, topic, signal)` and
  the supporting keys are merged, so a mirror turn, a re-extraction of the same
  sentence or a summary of the same utterance adds no extra support.
